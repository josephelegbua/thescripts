                <p>The truth is, being successful in dating and relationships is not simply about confidence in who we are, it’s about competence in what we do. And most people (<i>women
                        and
                        men</i>) never learn how to communicate effectively.</p>
                <p>There are <strong>very specific words and phrases we can say to a person to <span>increase</span> attraction</strong>. And, if we’re not careful, there are things we can
                    accidentally say to
                    <span>decrease</span>
                    attraction.</p>
                <p>If you don’t know the right words to say, you can’t communicate who you REALLY are in the most attractive, compelling way. And even more frustrating is when the man
                    you’re interested in ends up with another woman (<i>maybe even one who isn’t as good a match</i>) because she knows this language of attraction.</p>
                <p>You’re right. It’s <i>not</i> fair. So let’s level the playing field…</p>
                <p>...I’ll show you <i>How to Talk to Men</i> and then YOU’LL win over other women because you’ll have BOTH: True warmth AND the ability to create and keep attraction
                    through
                    your language.</p>

                    <p>The good news? Learning to communicate in a way that shows him the High-Value Woman you are is a SIMPLE fix. And once you have these sample scripts, you’ll learn how

                    <dt>What if it doesn’t work for me?</dt>
                    <dd>I am so confident that <i>How to Talk to Men</i> will work for you because it has gotten results for so many women I’ve coached throughout the years. But if it
                        doesn’t work
                        for you for any reason, you don’t pay. Just send an email to Courtney, my head of customer support, at <a class="email"
                                                                                                                                  href="mailto:support@howtogettheguy.com"><strong>support@howtogettheguy.com</strong></a>
                        within 60 days of your purchase and
                        we’ll quickly give you a 100% refund. No questions and no hassle.

                    <dt>What if I have questions about my order?</dt>
                    <dd>I’ve assigned Courtney personally to take care of members of this program so if you need anything at all just contact her at <a class="email"
                                                                                                                                                        href="mailto:support@howtogettheguy.com"><strong>support@howtogettheguy.com</strong></a>
                        and she’ll
